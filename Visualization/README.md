# Visualization
Use Python library `Matplotlib` to implement some data visualization.
## Temperature Trend
`y1` and `y2` represent the temperature of room1 and room2 from 10:00 to 12:00, respectively, and draw a line chart to observe the change of temperature.
```
y1 = [random.randint(20, 35) for i in range(0, 120, 3)]
y2 = [random.randint(20, 35) for i in range(0, 120, 3)]
```
